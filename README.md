# Optimization of a product store layout using genetic algorithm
### Abstract
An optimization problem occurs when designing a warehouse layout. The location of the products must be such that when an order arrives, the distance traveled is the minimum. To solve this problem, a genetic algorithm was used, with which the most optimal layout was obtained based on several orders
